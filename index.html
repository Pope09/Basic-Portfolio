        Infact, working with physicians, nurses, hospital administrators and other stakeholders in the healthcare industry is something i love most. </p> 
      <p> Beside working as a consultant, programming has been a huge part of my life for as long as I remmember.
           <br> I started out programming some basic software languages on my own until i got help from my very good friend and a brother.
           <br>I feel  passing for coding and aspiring to make significant contribution to the healthcare industry in the future with programmming.</p>
      <p> It is worthy to mention that, family and friends have been the backborne of my academic and career successes.
